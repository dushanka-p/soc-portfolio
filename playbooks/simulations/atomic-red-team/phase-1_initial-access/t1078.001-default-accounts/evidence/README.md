# Evidence — {ART_ID} — sanitized

This folder contains **sanitized examples** or pointers to privately-stored raw logs.

**Do not commit raw logs to this folder in the public branch.**

Files that may appear here (sanitized):
- `securityevent_example.json` — sanitized extract (remove IPs, hostnames, UPNs)
- `sysmon_example.json` — sanitized extract
- `screenshot_example.png` — redacted screenshot (blur sensitive areas)

If raw logs are required for review, store them in a private storage path and reference them here.

# soc-portfolio

One-page index for my Security Operations work: simulations, detections, and honeypot investigations.  
Tools used: **Azure VMs, Microsoft Defender, Microsoft Sentinel, GitHub**.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Projects (short index)
- **Simulations**
  - `soc-phish-sim` â€” Phish â†’ PowerShell stager â†’ persistence â†’ beacon â†’ mock exfil (Azure VM victim).  
- **Honeypot & Investigations**
  - `honeypot-investigations` â€” Honeypot telemetry, triage guides, IoC extraction, timeline reports.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure (Wireframe)

```
soc-portfolio/                <- umbrella (index repo)
â”œâ”€ simulations/               <- all benign SOC simulations
â”‚  â””â”€ soc-phish-sim/          <- phishing â†’ stager â†’ beacon â†’ mock exfil (Azure VM + Defender + Sentinel)
â”‚
â””â”€ honeypot-investigations/   <- honeypot logs, IoC extraction, triage + investigation reports
```

## ðŸ”’ Visibility & where to find artifacts
- **Public:** playbooks, detection rules, sanitized evidence, demo videos.  
- **Private:** raw PCAPs, full memory dumps, unredacted logs, tenant secrets (stored in private repos or private folder).  
- **Sanitization:** use `scripts/collect_artifacts.*` to redact hostnames, IPs, and usernames before publishing.

---

## ðŸ“‹ For recruiters / reviewers (what to expect)
- Demo-ready repos with: short TL;DR, one-click run instructions (lab-only), detection queries, and sanitized timelines.  
- Live honeypot repo: real telemetry + repeatable triage steps demonstrating detection â†’ investigation â†’ remediation.

---

## ðŸ›¡ Safety & ethics (must-read)
- All simulations use **benign scripts only** and are to be run in isolated lab VMs.  
- Raw sensitive artifacts are never public. See each repo's `SECURITY.md` for details.

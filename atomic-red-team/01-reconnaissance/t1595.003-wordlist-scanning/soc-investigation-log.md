## üß† Triage Questions

* **Was the behavior expected in this lab?**
  
* **Which artifacts prove the technique worked?**
  
* **Did it cause any follow-up processes or network activity?**
  
* **Was the user elevated or used for (action)?**
  
* **Any lateral movement or signs of privilege escalation?**

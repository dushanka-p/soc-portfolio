## üß† Triage Questions


* **Was the behavior expected in this lab?**
  Yes, this was a controlled simulation.

* **Which artifacts prove the technique worked?**

  * Successful `net user` and `net1.exe` commands
  * Group membership changes (Administrators, Remote Desktop Users)
  * Registry modifications to enable RDP

* **Did it cause any follow-up processes or network activity?**
  No evidence of external network connections or suspicious follow-up processes in the immediate aftermath. No RDP logins detected‚Äîjust setup actions.

* **Was the user elevated or used for RDP?**
  Yes. The `guest` account was enabled, had its password set, added to Administrators and Remote Desktop Users groups, and RDP was enabled via registry change.

* **Any lateral movement or signs of privilege escalation?**
  No lateral movement observed. Privilege escalation occurred (guest added to privileged groups), but no attempts to move to other hosts detected.

## üìÇ Timeline (Key Events)

| Time (VM Local) | Time (Sentinel/UTC) | Event Description                                                                |
| --------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 18:41:40        | 19:41:40            | Recon: `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` run to check context                      |
| 18:41:42        | 19:41:42            | `cmd.exe` runs multiple commands: enables guest, adds to Admin/RDP, enables RDP  |
| 18:41:43        | 19:41:43            | `net1.exe`/`net.exe` add guest to Administrators and Remote Desktop Users groups |
| 18:41:43        | 19:41:43            | `reg.exe` modifies Terminal Server registry to allow RDP                         |
| 18:41:43        | 19:41:43            | Guest password set (`net1.exe user guest Password123!`)                          |
| 18:41:43        | 19:41:43            | Verification: `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe` (context after changes)               |
| 18:41:41+       | 19:41:41+           | **Sentinel alert triggered (DP_IR_Default_Accounts_Creation)**                   |
